**What did you learn about how WordPress stores its files and data?**

- I learned that WordPress stores its files and data separately. The core files, themes, plugins, and media uploads are stored in folders on the server, while the website’s content, settings, and user information are saved in a MySQL database. This separation makes it easier to manage design and data independently.

**Which part was more complex handling files or managing the database?**

-Managing the database was more complex because it involves exporting, importing, and making sure the data is correctly linked to the website’s configuration. A small mistake in the database settings can cause the site to break or lose content.

**Why is version control useful for a WordPress project in an office setting?**

- Version control is useful because it allows multiple team members to work on the project at the same time, track changes, and revert to previous versions if something goes wrong. It helps maintain organization, accountability, and collaboration in a shared work environment.
